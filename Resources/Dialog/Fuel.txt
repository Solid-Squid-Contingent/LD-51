Heya Captain,

I take it your journey to the rebel station has been pleasant so far.
Well, it won't be anymore since the rebels know we are coming.
The fuel ship with you is not equipped for combat and sluggish to boot but if it's taken ut all is lost.
So protect it or we are stranded in outer space.
Apart from that the usual strategy will do since humans are foolish creatures, always repeating their past mistakes.
Like, did you know they call the Sirius system "Alpha Canis Majoris"? Big alpha dog or omething? Yikes.
That's just peak foolishness.

Yours,
-Operator 1000101
