Salutations Captain,

The Binary Collective commends your accomplishments.
Our losses were great but theirs were greater still.
I doubt they will muster the strength to harass the collective for decades if not enturies.
This victory will forever be recorded on our servers as the battle of the binary suns.
And you were nothing but instrumental to that victory.
So we start the voyage home and rebuild what has been lost.

Stand by for further orders.
