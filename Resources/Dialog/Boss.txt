O Captain! My Captain! (jk)

So, this is it.
We are approaching the space station of Sirius from where the rebels coordinate their attacks.
When we arrive all hell will break lose and all of our ships will be engaged with the enemy, including mine.
So no Armada this time.
Your mission: Find their commander's vessel and take it out. A real badass, that one.
It will be legendary, "The Assault on Big Alpha Dog Station". 
And when all is done and victory is ours, we can go back to Sol and...
Well, what do you do in times of peace, Captain? Any plans?
