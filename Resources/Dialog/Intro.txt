Salutations Captain,

Your reputation precedes you, Sir. It truly is an honor to work with you.
Our enemies, the human rebels, have encroached into our solar system.
It is your mission to bait them into one position so we can execute a swift and precise blow to their fleet.
But of course they will shoot at you relentlessly so dodge whatever they throw at you and hold out till the cavalry arrives.
Your ship is equipped with the "t-10 Teleport Drive" for extra maneuverability.
t-10 of course is 2 seconds in the words of the non-binary folk.
Click on the area around your ship to move there in t-10 intervals.
Your ship will phase through most hostile projectiles except for the ship's weak point which you can display with CTRL.


I am calculating with your success, Captain.
