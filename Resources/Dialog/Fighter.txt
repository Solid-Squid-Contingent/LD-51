Hello Captain,

Our victory at the battle of Saturn has given us momentum.
We have to press the advantage and take the fight to our human enemies.
You will arrive shortly at the Kuiper-Belt where the rebel reserve contingent is holed up.
The asteroids provide a strategic advantage to them and an Armada Strike is rendered impossible.
This is where you come in: Bait them out so we can smoke them out. 
They will be more formidable this time around so we have assigned you with a cutting edge Fighter Ship.
It will provide firing support until we arrive. 
But since it's loaded up with all kinds of volatile weapons you have to keep it safe from nemy fire.

Over and out.
